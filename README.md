## Skills

#### Communication, negotiation

- Excellent communication skills honed through almost a decade of customer facing advice roles discussing difficult subjects and negotiating agreements/plans to deal with financial issues.
- Through giving insolvancy advice to a wide range of clients I gained the ability to explain complicated concepts in simple, understandable terms without using jargon.

#### Problem solving

I have methodical approach to dealing with any technical problem presented. I have strong questioning and note taking inclination, from this basis I will make a plan and work towards my goal of completing the project. 
I have ten years experiance of dealing with people in financial distress, in order to find a solution to the problems they faced I needed to take an overview of their situation, break it down into key components. Drill down on critical pieces of information, be able to provide easily digestible advice about the importance and potential consequences of a situation and then provide a bespoke debt solution and then negotiating, breaking down and selling the pros and cons of said solution. Since retraining I focuss on designing apps from a test driven development appraoch, breaking down the brief into core components, diagraming the structure of the apps and begining by writing tests first.

Strong interpersonal skills, negotiating skills, breaking down problems and planning solutions, ruby and javasrcipty languges.

- Working within makers to build working software apps
- Completing final group project.

#### Teamwork and training

During makers I pair programmed every day and worked within teams on three group projects to build working web apps. I led stand ups and retros,took part in planning sessions to agree: the product, the minnimum viable product and acheivable sprint goals.
I engaged in working within many teams, discussing and plannign training new starters and preparing them for money and debt advice roles. Breaking down skills that need to be used, explaining negotiation, explaining complex information, being an approachable and valuded point of contact.

Ability to work within a team, presenting information, knowledge of powerpoint.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Aug 2022 - Dec 2022)

Makers was an instenisive 16 week software development bootcamp. During my time there we used Ruby and Javascript, we learnt and used concepts like test driven devolpment to solve problems. I pair programmed with other members of my cohort every day, I took part in three group projects where we developed software applications as a team. During these projects we planned out the application using diagraming tools like excalidraw, created tickets on a communal trello board, we had sprints to complete various parts of the development process, we had stand ups every morning and retros either at the end of the day or sprint period.  
During my time there I enhanced my bbility to learn new languages in a short speace of time and became more adaptable to using new technologies.
