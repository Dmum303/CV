## Skills

#### Communication, negotiation, presentation

- Excellent communication skills honed through a decade of customer facing advice roles discussing difficult subjects and negotiating solutions to deal with financial crises. I am able to explain complicated concepts in simple terms without using jargon.
- I am a confident public speaker in both formal and informal settings. I delivered training courses at roles in Stepchange and multiple project presentations at Makers Academy. 

#### Systematic and inquisitive problem solver

- My focus on designing and creating apps is from a test driven development approach, breaking down requirements into core components, diagramming the structure of the apps and beginning by writing tests first.
- From almost a decade of working with people in financial distress, in order so I could find a solution to the problems they faced I would take an overview of their situation, break it down into key components, drill down on critical pieces of information and then provide easily digestible advice about the importance and potential consequences of a situation. Providing a bespoke debt solution and then negotiating, breaking down and selling the pros and cons of said solution.

#### Confident teamplayer and individual worker

- I took a leading role in group projects at Makers, organising the project group and formalising our team work approach, designing and building large sections of the backend of the application - this was completed whilst pairing on development.
- I have strong interpersonal skills developed over years working in client facing roles: active listening, empathy, handling conflict and remaining positive in the face of difficult situations.
- I am happy to use my own initiative to work either on my own or with minimal guidance, as evidenced by the personal projects I have built; in a group setting I communicate with the team to make sure we are clear on goals and priorities. 

#### Adept and flexible leaner 

- Learnt the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) within two weeks to used for group projects during Makers bootcamp.
- Balanced full time work  whilst learning Ruby langauge.
