## David Thomson

I have recently graduated from makers bootcamp, regularly rated as one of the best in the world, having spent 16 weeks intensively training to be a software developer. I have 17 years work experience in a viriety of roles before deciding to retrain. My last 10 years working life was providing money advice and debt solutions in client facing roles. I am excited by the limitless possiblities of tech, it's ubiquity and the solutions it can bring to existing real world problems.

## Skills

#### Problem solving

I have methodical approach to dealing with any technical problem presented. I have strong questioning and note taking inclination, from this basis I will make a plan and work towards my goal of completing the project. 
I have ten years experiance of dealing with people in some sort of financial distress, in order to find a solution to the problems they faced I needed to take an overview of their situation, break it down into key components. Drill down on critical pieces of information, be able to provide easily digestible advice about the importance and potential consequences of a situation and then provide a bespoke debt solution and then negotiating, breaking down and selling the pros and cons of said solution. Since retraining I focuss on designing apps from a test driven development appraoch, breaking down the brief into core components, diagraming the structure of the apps and begining by writing tests first.
