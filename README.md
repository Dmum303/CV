## About me

I am a motivated and resourceful junior full stack software developer.

I have recently graduated from Makers, regularly rated as one of the best bootcamps in the world. I spent 16 weeks intensively training to be a software developer. Makers taught an agile approach to working, test driven design and language agnostic mind frame. I am able to learn new concepts/technologies/frameworks quickly and use established software best practices.   

I have 17 previous years work experience in a variety of roles before deciding to change careers. My last 10 years working life was providing money advice and debt solutions to clients struggling financially. I am excited by the limitless possibilities of tech, it's ubiquity and the solutions it can bring to existing real world problems.

## Skills

#### Communication, negotiation, presentation

- Excellent communication skills honed through almost a decade of customer facing advice roles discussing difficult subjects and negotiating agreements/plans to deal with financial issues.
- Through giving insolvancy advice to a wide range of clients I gained the ability to explain complicated concepts in simple, understandable terms without using jargon.
- I have given multiple presentations using powerpoint both at roles within stepchange debt advice charity and at makers academy. I am confident in public speaking - I have alsio given four best man speeches so far.

#### Systematic and inquisitive problem solver

- My focus on designing and creating apps is from a test driven development appraoch, breaking down requirements into core components, diagraming the structure of the apps and begining by writing tests first.
- From almost a decade of working with people in financial distress, in order so I could find a solution to the problems they faced I would take an overview of their situation, break it down into key components, drill down on critical pieces of information and then provide easily digestible advice about the importance and potential consequences of a situation. Providing a bespoke debt solution and then negotiating, breaking down and selling the pros and cons of said solution.


#### Confident teamplayer and individual worker

- During my time at makers I took part in three group projects in which I played a leading role, designing and building large sections of the backend of the application - this was completed whilst pairing with a partner.
- I have strong interpersonal skills, developed over years working in client facing roles: active listening, empathy, handling conflict and remaining positive in the face of difficult situations.
- I am happy to use my own initiative to work either on my own or with minimal guidence, as evidenced by the personal projects I have built, however in a work environment it is important to keep in contact with your team to make sure we are on the same page for the project that is being built. 

#### Adept and flexible leaner 

- Learnt the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) within two weeks to used for group projects during Makers bootcamp.
- Balanced full time work  whilst learning Ruby langauge.

#### Makers Academy (Aug 2022 - Dec 2022)

Makers was an instenisive 16 week software development bootcamp. During my time there we used Ruby and Javascript, we learnt and used concepts like test driven devolpment to solve problems. I pair programmed with other members of my cohort every day, I took part in three group projects where we developed software applications as a team. During these projects we planned out the application using diagraming tools like excalidraw, created tickets on a communal trello board, we had sprints to complete various parts of the development process, we had stand ups every morning and retros either at the end of the day or sprint period.  
During my time there I enhanced my bbility to learn new languages in a short speace of time and became more adaptable to using new technologies.
