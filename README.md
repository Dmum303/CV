## Skills

#### Problem solving

I have ten years experiance of dealing with people in some sort of financial distress, in order to find a solution to the problems they faced I needed to take an overview of their situation, break it down into key components. Drill down on critical pieces of information, be able to provide easily digestible advice about the importance and potential consequences of a situation and then provide a bespoke debt solution and then negotiating, breaking down and selling the pros and cons of said solution.

Strong interpersonal skills, negotiating skills, breaking down problems and planning solutions.
